# Install
```
pip install Pyllab
```

Warning:

from pip you will download the corresponding .whl file according to your OS and python version.
All the .whl files have been created from the compilation of C code. The files on pypi have been compiled
for the x86_64 architecture with the extensions "-mavx2". So, if you have a pentium for example
or a processor that does not support the extension avx2 you can find in the github repo in the releases
the different .whl files with: no extensions, sse extension, sse2 extension, avx extension.

or


# Build .whl package On Linux:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh generate_wheel_unix.sh
```

- On Linux specifically you have to fix the wheel package, use the container with the repair tool:

```
sudo docker run -i -t -v `pwd`:/io quay.io/pypa/manylinux1_x86_64 /bin/bash
```

when you are in run these lines:

```
cd io
sh repair_wheel_linux.sh
```

in the wheelhouse directory you have the fixed wheel package

# Build .whl package on MacOS
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh generate_wheel_unix.sh
sh repair_wheel_macos.sh
```

# Build .whl package on Windows

- It is a PIA. Why?

Pyllab is a cython library compiling .C files that use posix calls system. Now you can see the problem here. Just follow me in this journey:

- First of all you need to comment this line in __init__.pyx:

```
ctypedef stdint.uint64_t uint64_t
```

- Install Mingw with MYSYS2: https://www.msys2.org/ follow the steps and also the passages to install mingw-w64 

-  now navigate to Pyllab with MYSYS2 and create the .lib library:

```
sh create_library.sh
```

- Go to your Python Folder (We assume as example we are using python 3.7):

- You can find your python folder with:

```
import sys
locate_python = sys.exec_prefix
print(locate_python)
```

- Create the file Python37\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg that should look like this:

```
[build]
compiler=mingw32
[build_ext]
compiler=mingw32
```

- Download this .dll file https://it.dllfile.net/microsoft/vcruntime140-dll:

- Move it to Python37\libs and to Python37\DLLs

- Move libllab.lib previously built to Python37\libs

- Now, Move to Python37\Lib\distutils\cygwinccompiler.py and modify the function get_msvcr() as follows: https://bugs.python.org/file40608/patch.diff

- The last part

```
elif msc_ver == '1900':
```

change it to 

```
elif msc_ver == '1916':
```

- Now other bug fix: go to Python37\include\pyconfig.h and add these lines:

```
/* Compiler specific defines */
#ifdef __MINGW32__
#ifdef _WIN64
#define MS_WIN64
#endif
#endif
```

- Now you can run from MYSYS2:

```
sh build_python_library.sh
```

# Install .whl files

Once you have created the .whl file, you can install it locally using pip:

```
pip install package.whl
```
# Import the library in python

```
import pyllab
```

# Pyllab supports

# Genome API

```
import pyllab
# Init a genome from a .bin file
g = pyllab.Genome("file.bin", input_size, output_size)
# Get the output from an input list
inputs = [1]*input_size
output = g.ff(inputs)
